# Energy Consumption Prediction

## Overview

This project is a web application that predicts energy consumption based on various input parameters such as temperature, humidity, square footage, and more. The application is built using Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python, and utilizes a machine learning model to make predictions.

## Features

- User-friendly web interface for inputting data.
- Predicts energy consumption based on user inputs.
- Dark-themed design with a responsive layout.
- Background image for enhanced visual appeal.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: Web framework for building the application.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis library.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for model training and predictions.
- **Bootstrap**: Frontend framework for responsive design.
- **HTML/CSS**: Markup and styling languages for the web interface.
